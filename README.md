## How To Get Started
Start by choosing one of the active governors in the Choose Governor dropdown. Next, choose one of the active facilities and start buying minerals!
Resources are a hot commodity, only 1 ton of any type of mineral can be purchased at a time. However, you can purchase many types of minerals at once. 
Add these minerals to your cart, purchase them, and watch your inventory magically update!
